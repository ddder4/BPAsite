				Video Games since their invention in the early 1950&#39;s have become exceedingly prevalent in society today, 
				even to the point that they can affect how we think and act. Video games over the period they have existed
				have been the tool for entertainment and stress relief, as well as the cause for anger 
				outbursts and bad hygiene. Multiple reports have revealed that Video Games have been 
				quite helpful to society, and harmful to many portions of it too. Many people find it 
				easy to just assume Video Games are all bad or all good, but like a lot of things in 
				life they are a peculiar mixture of both. The debate on whether these much adored forms 
				of recreation are beneficial or damaging to us, isn&#39;t so much the Video Game itself but 
				the perspective of the player.
