				<h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Overview:</h2>
				Most parents that dont know much about video games think that they
				only kill brain cells and are bad for kids to play. This is not 
				necessarily true. Video games actually provide people a lot of skill
				that they can use in real life! Some of these skills can be aplied 
				better than others, but they are all still helpful.
				
				<a name="Healthy"></a><h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Healthy Games:</h2>
				
				Some games that are good for people to play are:
				
				<ul>
					<li>Civilization V</li>
					<li>Minecraft</li>
					<li>League of Legends</li>
					
				</ul>
				
				Team based games like League of Legends make the player work with
				a team and communicate to accomplish a goal. A strategy game like
				Civilization V make a player use their head and think of a way out 
				of the situation they are currently facing. A free open world game 
				like Minecraft make players use their creative side to build whatever
				they want and they feel accomplished when they achieve their goal.
								
				<a name="Positive"></a><h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Positive Side Effects:</h2>
				
				Some games are better to play than others. Strategy games make you use your head 
				and think of different ways to outthink your opponent. First person shooter games
				build multi-tasking skills because the player must focus and keep track of different 
				things going on all at once. A third thing that is a positive outcome from playing games
				is teamwork skills. In most competitive games such as League of Legends, the player
				works on a team of other people to push and fight to the enemy base. The teams work together
				and push toward the other team's spawn point and cover each other in order to defeat the other
				team. A fourth thing that playing video games helps with is communication. Comunication and 
				Teamwork go hand in hand. When a person plays games with a team, a crucial part of teamwork
				is communication. When the player plays the game they need to talk to their team in order
				to make things known. They ask for help and notify a teammate of an enemy's position and then
				they work together in order to fight that enemy.
