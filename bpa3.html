				Video Games not only have a positive use, but they also under certain circumstances
				can also have negative effects. Video games if used without moderation have harmful
				effects on a person's health. Some people who have current health issues, might 
				experiance greater side effects when playing Video Games.
				
				<a name="Healthy"></a><h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Unhealthy Games:</h2>
				
				Some games that are bad for people to play are:
				
				<ul>
					<li>Civilization V</li>
					<li>Minecraft</li>
					<li>League of Legends</li>
				</ul>
				
				The same games that can produce a positive side effects can also produce negative 
				side effects. For instance, someone who has anger issues can play a game like minecraft
				to relieve stress where another person with anger issues can play the same game and die 
				inside the game and then become enraged. Playing video games for an extended period
				of time can develop things like Carpal Tunnel and poor hygiene. They can also develop 
				eating disorder because they put the game before their own personal good.
