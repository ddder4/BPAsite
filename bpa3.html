				<h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Overview:</h2>
				Video Games not only have a positive use, but they also under certain circumstances
				can also have negative effects. Video games if used without moderation have harmful
				effects on a person's health. Some people who have current health issues, might 
				experiance greater side effects when playing Video Games.

				Some games that are bad for people to play are:
				
				<ul>
					<li>Civilization V</li>
					<li>Minecraft</li>
					<li>League of Legends</li>
				</ul>
				
				The same games that can produce a positive side effects can also produce negative 
				side effects. For instance, someone who has anger issues can play a game like minecraft
				to relieve stress where another person with anger issues can play the same game and die 
				inside the game and then become enraged. Playing video games for an extended period
				of time can develop things like Carpal Tunnel and poor hygiene. They can also develop 
				eating disorder because they put the game before their own personal good.

<h3>Health:</h3>

<p>People&#39;s health is a big concern when they are addicted to video games. When addicted to games people will ignore many things 
that are important to their health.  One thing that people do when addicted to video games is stop eating and starve themselves. 
The reason why is because they think their games are more important than making sure that they are well nourished. Also people do 
not take care of their personal hygiene. People will go for long periods of time without cleansing themselves.</p>
<br />
<h3>Stress:</h3>

<p>Some games require a lot of concentration but people donâ€™t like spending all of their time putting in dedication or trying their
 best in a game. People in this era want instant gratification when they are playing games without putting much effort into it. 
 One thing is that there are many games that will punish the player and send them back far distances in the game. This creates 
 stress in gamers since a good amount of progress that they make can be gone in an instant.</p>
<br />
<h3>Anger:</h3>

<p>Frustration and hostile behavior caused by failure in games is also a major problem. There are many games that cause this 
kind of negative feeling. People have been pushed to the point in which they physically hurt themselves or others. Sometime 
they will also throw and break objects. People have also been known to destroy the consoles and controllers that they play their games on as well.</p>
